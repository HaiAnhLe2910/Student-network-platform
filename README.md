## Introduction

The web application is a student networking system which helps students to create and manage their personal projects outside school. The fellow students can therefore search and join whatever projects they want. As a project owner, the student can create, update and delete their project and accept/ decline the join requests. He/She also can join other projects. As a normal member, student can join the projects, search/filter projects and receive email notification whenever their request to join a project is declined/accepted.
